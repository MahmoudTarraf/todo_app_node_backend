✅ Fix Step by Step
1. Close anything locking the folder

Close your editor/IDE (VS Code, WebStorm, etc.).

Close any terminal that’s inside that project folder.

Then reopen a new PowerShell/Command Prompt as Administrator.

2. Manually delete node_modules and lock file

Run in PowerShell (as admin):

rd /s /q node_modules
del package-lock.json


If Windows still refuses, you can force delete with:

npx rimraf node_modules

3. Clean npm cache
npm cache clean --force
